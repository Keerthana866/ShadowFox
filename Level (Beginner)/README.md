# Boston House Price Prediction  

This project is part of my internship task. It predicts house prices in Boston using machine learning (Linear Regression).  

# Project Overview  
- Dataset: `HousingData.csv` (includes features like number of rooms, crime rate, etc.)  
- Model: Linear Regression  
- Libraries used:  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - scikit-learn  

#  Steps Involved  
1. Data Preprocessing (handled missing values)  
2. Splitting dataset into training and testing sets  
3. Training Linear Regression model  
4. Evaluating performance (MSE, RÂ² Score)  
5. Visualizing actual vs predicted prices  

## Results  
- The model predicts Boston house prices fairly accurately.  
- Evaluation metrics are printed in the console when you run the code.  
- A scatter plot compares actual vs predicted values.  

# How to Run  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
python task.py
